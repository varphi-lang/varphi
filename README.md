This is the main source code repository for Varphi. It contains the compiler, interpreter, standard library, and documentation.

## Why Varphi?

* **Productivity:** Designing Turing programs in longhand is tedious and can lead to errors. Having a dedicated, maintained programming langugage for Turing programs makes development times much faster, and Varphi debugging tools ensure programs are correct.
* **Compactness:** Just one executable (the interpreter, `vpi`) is all you need to get started with Varphi on any operating system.
* **Support:** Varphi is constantly being maintained and new features are being added.
